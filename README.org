[[http://book.realworldhaskell.org/][Real World Haskell]] by Bryan
O'Sullivan, Don Stewart and John Goerzen seems to contain most of what I need
to learn to become a productive haskeller but it's old (it was published in 2008)
so let's update it! After all it is distributed under the terms of the

I'm going to focus on the /real world/ stuff because I'm a newbie and I can
yell at GHC until I get it to compile but I can't do the same with math so
even when I think Haskell theory is fascinating I'm not ready to tackle that
part. BTW would you like to help?

I did chose Org mode althoug I'm a [[https://neovim.io][Neovim]] user because amazing and
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][well documented]].

English is not my native language so I'm sure this will be full of grammar
and other errors ðŸ˜…
